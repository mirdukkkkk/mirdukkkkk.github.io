# Site with my links & contacts
You can see an already live version at https://mirdukkkkkkkk.space

## How to run?
Just make a local server on `./docs/index.html` (or open index.html in your browser)

---

## It works just as well without JavaScript
You can disable JavaScript on the site, it will work the same way, except with a random highlight color, random greetings and no starry background
